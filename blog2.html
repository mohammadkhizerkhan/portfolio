        <h3>What is time management</h3>
        <p style="font-family: 'Balsamiq Sans', cursive;">
            The ability to use one’s time effectively or productively, especially at work.“Time management” refers to the way that you organize and plan how long you spend on specific activities.
        </p>
        <h2>Benifits Of Time-management</h2>
        <ol>
            <li class="blog-list">
                <h3 class="blog-list-h3">Effective Planning</h3>
                <p style="font-family: 'Balsamiq Sans', cursive;">Plan your day well in advance. Prepare a To Do List or a “TASK PLAN”. Jot down the important activities that need to be done in a single day against the time that should be allocated to each activity. High Priority work should come on top followed by those which do not need much of your importance at the moment. Complete pending tasks one by one. Do not begin fresh work unless you have finished your previous task. Tick the ones you have already completed. Ensure you finish the tasks within the stipulated time frame.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="blog-list">
                <h3 class="blog-list-h3">Setting Goals and Objectives</h3>
                <p style="font-family: 'Balsamiq Sans', cursive;">Working without goals and targets in an organization would be similar to a situation where the captain of the ship loses his way in the sea. Yes, you would be lost. Set targets for yourself and make sure they are realistic ones and achievable.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="blog-list">
                <h3 class="blog-list-h3">Setting Deadlines</h3>
                <p style="font-family: 'Balsamiq Sans', cursive;">Set deadlines for yourself and strive hard to complete tasks ahead of the deadlines. Do not wait for your superiors to ask you everytime. Learn to take ownership of work. One person who can best set the deadlines is you yourself. Ask yourself how much time needs to be devoted to a particular task and for how many days. Use a planner to mark the important dates against the set deadlines.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="blog-list">
                <h3 class="blog-list-h3">Prioritizing Tasks</h3>
                <p style="font-family: 'Balsamiq Sans', cursive;">Prioritize the tasks as per their importance and urgency. Know the difference between important and urgent work. Identify which tasks should be done within a day, which all should be done within a month and so on. Tasks which are most important should be done earlier.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li class="blog-list">
                <h3 class="blog-list-h3">Delegation of Responsibilities</h3>
                <p style="font-family: 'Balsamiq Sans', cursive;">PLearn to say “NO” at workplace. Don’t do everything on your own. There are other people as well. One should not accept something which he knows is difficult for him. The roles and responsibilities must be delegated as per interest and specialization of employees for them to finish tasks within deadlines. A person who does not have knowledge about something needs more time than someone who knows the work well.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li class="blog-list">
                <h3 class="blog-list-h3">Spending the right time on right activity</h3>
                <p style="font-family: 'Balsamiq Sans', cursive;">Develop the habit of doing the right thing at the right time. Work done at the wrong time is not of much use. Don’t waste a complete day on something which can be done in an hour or so. Also keep some time separate for your personal calls or checking updates on Facebook or Twitter. After all human being is not a machine.

                <h3 class="blog-list-h3">Set a goal for yourself</h3>
                <p style="font-family: 'Balsamiq Sans', cursive;"> Know what you want to achieve in life. Take a pen and paper and write down where you want to see yourself five years from now. Setting an objective for yourself gives you a sense of direction.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="blog-list">
                <h3 class="blog-list-h3">Organize your study space.</h3>
                <p style="font-family: 'Balsamiq Sans', cursive;"> Arrange books and study material properly at their respective places. Stationery items must not be scattered on the table.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="blog-list">
                <h3 class="blog-list-h3">Plan your studies.</h3>
                <p style="font-family: 'Balsamiq Sans', cursive;"> Understand what all subjects are important and need to be done first. Go through your syllabus carefully. Find out the weightage of each subject and prepare a Task plan accordingly. Jot down what all subjects you think should be covered in a single day against specific time slots. Make sure you cover important topics first and then come to relatively easier ones. Beginning your day with something which is not that important is a sheer waste of time.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="blog-list">
                <h3 class="blog-list-h3">Do not go for long calls during study time</h3>
                <p style="font-family: 'Balsamiq Sans', cursive;"> One needs to set his /her priorities. Understand what is more important for you? Remember you will have ample time to catch up with all your friends once you clear your entrance exams and get into one of your dream business schools.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li class="blog-list">
                <h3 class="blog-list-h3">Make sure your study space is well lit and ventilated.</h3>
                <p style="font-family: 'Balsamiq Sans', cursive;">Dark corners make you feel sleepy and one finds it difficult to concentrate in studies and eventually wastes half of his/her time.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li class="blog-list">
                <h3 class="blog-list-h3">It is essential to choose the right time for studies.</h3>
                <p style="font-family: 'Balsamiq Sans', cursive;"> MBA preparation is no joke and requires focus, concentration and planning. Prefer studying in the morning hours with less or no disturbance.
