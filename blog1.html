            Productivity is the efficiency of production of goods or services expressed by some measure. Measurements of productivity are often expressed as a ratio of an aggregate output to a single input or an aggregate input used in a production process, i.e. output per unit of input, typically over a specific period of time.

                <div><img src="/images2/To-do-List-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="400px" height="250px"></div>
                <p style="font-family: 'Balsamiq Sans', cursive;">The to-do list is one of the most widely used productivity tactics. For years, I also had a list of dozens of items. When I started researching productivity, I thought the to-do list was a must.
                Thereâ€™s also scientific evidence that writing down uncompleted tasks decreases anxiety. And people have been using the to-do list for hundreds of years. Apparently, Benjamin Franklin used it as well.

                <div><img src="/images2/Does-Power-Napping-Make-a-Better-CEO.jpg" alt="" width="400px" height="250px"></div>
                <p style="font-family: 'Balsamiq Sans', cursive;">Short breaks not only mean power naps,you can go outside take some fresh air,dirnk some water,talk to your subordinates.the best for me is taking nap(which is average of about 20minutes) or if i am busy i would take power nap(5-10 minutes).the reason why i choose naps is i get distract when i get interested in some other things like if i talk to my friends i'll definetlly lost my focus so napping would be better.

                <p style="font-family: 'Balsamiq Sans', cursive;">Constant notifications and text messages are every college student's enemy. Put your phone on silent or in "Do Not Disturb" mode, and close unnecessary tabs on your computer. If you need the Internet, keep one tab open. You can fight online distractions by blocking or hiding time-wasting websites and apps.If you're working in a noisy environment, use noise-canceling headphones. Listening to music through earbuds can also tune out distracting noises like people talking too loudly or construction work. Often, though, music with lyrics can be too distracting. Researchers suggest listening to classical or instrumental music to improve concentration.
